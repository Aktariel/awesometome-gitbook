# Ironling

TODO: ironling description.

* __Size:__ Medium
* __Type:__ Construct (Living)
* __Movement:__ 30ft
* __Vision:__ Standard
* __Ability Modifiers:__ +2 Constitution
* __Living Construct (Ex):__ As a living construct, an ironling doesn't eat, breathe, or sleep. They technically age, but individual parts can be replaced over time, so they effectively do not. Positive energy heals an ironling and negative energy hurts an ironling.
* __No Blood (Ex):__ Ironlings aren't subject to poison, disease, or blood-related attacks, including both bleeding damage and constitution damage from blood loss. An ironling reduced to negative hit points is rendered unconscious but automatically stabilizes. If an ironling has the Ferocity ability they still take 1 damage per round of activity while at negative hit points.
* __Iron Fists (Ex):__ An ironling's unarmed attacks deal 1d4 lethal damage, and they count as being armed at all times. Ironlings occasionally graft actual weaponry directly to their body as well. Treat this as a Locked Gauntlet type of effect (+10 vs Disarm attempts, full-round action that provokes to attach or remove a weapon).
* __Iron Skin (Ex):__ An ironling's basic body plates give them a +2 Armor bonus (no max dex, no armor check penalty or armor stealth penalty). They can wear better suits of armor on top of this, or they can even replace their basic plates with better armor plates. Same effect either way, just flavor differences.
* __Automatic Languages:__ Common
* __Suggested Bonus Language:__ Any
