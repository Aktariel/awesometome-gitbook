# Drow
_"Time to die for the Spider Queen."_

The Drow are a type of elf that long ago turned away from the rest of elven society and moved deep underground. They've since adapted to underground life, and developed a rather different culture from that of the elven norm. The drow are an extremely stratified and matriarchal society, with priestesses of the spider goddess at the top, then the rest of the drow population, and then below that there's usually a large number of non-drow slaves.

Drow are slightly taller and slightly lighter than humans tend to be. Their skin can be any sort of colors, as long as it's some shade of black. Unlike most "black" humans which are actually a very dark brown, drow have skin that is actually black; "black as the night, black as coal", as some say. Drow hair is generally white, gray, or a very pale shade of some other color. Drow can live for centuries, and those with any sort of power have more to fear from assassination than they do from old age.
