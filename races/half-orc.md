# Half-orc
_"I don't fit in anywhere, but you may be surprised to know that this dagger fits all kinds of places."_

With all the wars that orcs and humans have, even periods of relative peace are rarely considered periods of friendship. So any time a Half-orc happens, both races tend to consider it an abomination. It doesn't matter that a Half-orc is a better leader than any of the other orcs. It doesn't matter that the Half-orc is tougher than any of the other Humans. He's hated simply for being. And that makes him perversely really good at finding out things he wants to know from people. He's dealt with prejudice all his life, and knows pretty much everything you'd want to know about working around it.

Physically, a half-orc combines about any combination of human and orc features that you can imagine. They're considered adults at 15, and can live to be 80 or more.
