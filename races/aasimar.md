# Aasimar
_"My grandparents were prettier than you can possibly imagine."_

Aasimar are people with Outsider heritage somewhere in their family tree. Usually not the immediately previous generation, that usually makes a half-whatever individual, but somewhere farther back. Despite their mixed heritage in the past, aasimar are a true-breeding race of their own. Two aasimar will have aasimar children, while aasimar and Humanoid parents will have children that are of either parent's race.

The common trait among aasimar is that their Outsider ancestors were always the prettiest forms of whatever outsider sub-group they belonged to, and the children have appearances to match. They are generally astute, though often with a desire to take action quickly in a situation. Most fall within the normal humanoid ranges of height and weight, with all sorts of skin and hair colors (including the weird ones that usually only elves have). Aasimar can probably live to be 300 years or more, but most people don't know for sure, because most aasimar die of something other than old age. Fate might just have it out for them.
