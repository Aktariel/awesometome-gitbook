# Goblin
_"You weren't hired to think. You were hired because you have opposable thumbs."_

Goblins are the weakest of the goblinoid races, and they tend to get a crap deal because of it. However, they are quite gifted mounted combatants. Why is this? Because they are the smallest and weakest of the goblinoids, the Worgs long ago enslaved the goblin people. That's right, the Worgs came in and imposed their dominion upon goblins, not the other way around. But time does funny things... Worgs are pretty stupid, and they don't have thumbs. So while they are individually powerful, eventually they were forced to have the Goblins do all the important stuff, like keep records and make decisions. So now, the Worgs have gone many generations doing pretty much whatever it is that their "servants" tell them to do. Which means that really the Goblins are totally in control. And because of this, Goblin children are practically born into the saddle. Those rich enough to afford a wolf to ride can be devastatingly effective lancers.

Goblins are usually about three feet tall, and of average build for their height. Their skin is usually various shades of light green and gray, but goblins are rather prone to mutations, and other colorations are common enough goblins don't think much of it. Goblin hair usually grows extremely short; light brown, blond, or ash gray being the most common. A goblin's eyes tend to be green, red, or some mixture of the two. Goblins become adults at age 13, and a goblin elder of 50 is considered very old.
