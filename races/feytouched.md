# Feytouched
_"All my life, I have never fit in. Not in town, not in the forest. In some integral fashion I am unlike those around me, and I believe it is my fate to live and die alone."_

Feytouched are individuals born from a Humanoid and a Fey. Because of the chaotic nature of the fey, those that result from Humanoid/Fey pairings have a wild diversity among individuals. Imagine a human mixed randomly with some sort of nature element, or perhaps more than one. Some have skin like rocks, some have eight eyes like a spider, and some look like burn victims, spreading the smell of charred meat anywhere they go. Just about any sort of weird thing you could imagine crossed into a human is a potential form that a feytouched can take. Feytouched reach maturity around 15 to 20, and they don't seem to actually ever get old beyond that.

Now if you're one of the people who wonders why feytouched are immune to Compulsions when neither Fey nor Humanoids are, you aren't alone. That question comes up about as often as any other with regards to the feytouched. Of course, not all of them born are immune to mind affecting magic, as you might expect from a group so diverse that some have bug parts and others are simply beautiful humans. The powers that a feytouched are born with are extremely random. Unfortunately, these mulish offspring are also interesting both in the general sense and, much more to their detriment, to other fairies in particular. The unmitigated interest of the fey is hard on a small child, so feytouched who are not immune to compulsion effects are going to find themselves at the bottom of a pond or jumping out of a tall tree long before they reach adulthood. Indeed, feytouched immune to compulsion effects are the only ones that ever reach maturity; the well meaning but deadly interest of the fairy family members simply weeds out any other possible results.
