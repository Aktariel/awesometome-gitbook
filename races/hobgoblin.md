# Hobgoblin
_"That's some tough talk from a man who wears a basket on his head."_

Hobgoblins are a human-sized goblinoid. Generally 6 to 6.5 feet, and from 150 to 200 lbs. Being goblinoids, a naturally mutagenic sort of people, hobgoblins have a great diversity of skin and hair coloration, but shades of orange and gray are perhaps the most common. Hobgoblin hair is usually dark gray, brown, or black, and grows both on their heads in the usual amount for humanoids, but also in tufts on their tall, pointy ears. Most hobgoblins have a moderate amount of hair on the rest of their body as well, though some have radically more or radically less than the hobgoblin average.

Hobgoblins finish most of thier growth at 16, but they aren't legally adults until they're 20 years old. They can generally live to 120 or so, but aren't considered "old" at all until 70. More than actual age, a hobgoblin's place within society is often greatly affected by how long they've practiced their trade or craft. Hobgoblins are usually expected to focus on a single persuit during their life, learning every nuance and detail of the work. Innovation by the young is often frowned upon as inexperience, though sometimes grudgingly accepted anyway, when a clear superority can be demonstrated.

Hobgoblin religious life is even more polytheistic than normal. Hobgoblin priests concern themselves with all sorts of local spirits, not just with a few of the "big distant gods". Hobgoblin teachings as a whole attempt to place great emphasis on the virtues of humbleness and tranquility, in an attempt to curb the fact that younger hobgoblins (as with the young of all races) can become quite worked up over "defending their reputation" against any sort of real or imagined slight.

Hobgoblins will eagerly trade with outsiders, but don't often appreciate them staying for long. Non-goblinoids are considered to be far too loud to be good guests. Hobgoblin merchants are well known for their rice wine, high quality swords, and finely woven silks. Their wide, wicker hats can easily distingush a hobgoblin caravan from a great distance away.
