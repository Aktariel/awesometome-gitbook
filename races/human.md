Humans. What is there to say about humans? We're all human, so I think you know plenty about them. I'll do the whole race writeup thing anyway, just for kicks.

Adult humans are generally 5 to 6 feet tall, and usually weigh anywhere from 100 to 200 lbs. Their hair is black, brown, or blonde. Human skin ranges wildly from a very dark brown (almost black, but generally not the "actual black" of a drow), on through various lighter shades of brown and tan. Those with lighter skin are more likely to have lighter hair as well. Human skin color shifts into a darker color somewhat when they're out in the sun too often, much more readily than with other humanoids. They call this being "tanned". The process just as readily reverses itself if they're kept inside for long enough. Human eyes generally have a pigment in them making them brown, but some of the lighter skinned humans lack this pigment (giving them blue eyes), or only have a partial amount (giving them the appearance of being greyish or greenish). A rare kind of human has a red/orange hair coloring and very light skin, and if they're in the sun too long they develop tiny orange spots on their skin rather than becoming tanned.

Humans aren't really all the way grown until around 18 to 20, but most of the growth is done by 16, and various human societies consider individuals to be adults anywhere from 13 to 18. Humans are considered to be "old" at 50, and they rarely live past 90 even when kept in good care.

Of all the races, Humans are perhaps the most likely to get bored. They usually end up looking for new things when given the chance. Saying that they like to explore a lot would be charitable, but it's somewhat more accurate to say that they like to exploit, and you simply have to explore first to know what it is you're going to try and profit from. They often lack the long-term expertise in a field that individuals of other races have, but any individual human can usually cover more jobs that need doing, which keeps their population as a whole relatively adaptable. Outsiders usually find humans to be excessively brash, and sometimes downright foolhardy.
