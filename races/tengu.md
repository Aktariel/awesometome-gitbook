# Tengu

TODO: Tengu description.

* __Size:__ Medium
* __Type:__ Humanoid (Avian)
* __Movement:__ 30ft
* __Vision:__ Low-light Vision
* __Ability Modifiers:__ +2 Intelligence, -2 Strength.
* __Crow's Claw Technique (Ex):__ Tengu add their Dexterity modifier, rather than their Strength modifier, to damage with melee and trown weapon attacks. If another ability lets them do this, they get +2 to damage on such attacks.
* __War's Harbinger (Ex):__ Tengu have proficiency with two additional melee weapons of any sort.
* __Heart Reader (Su):__ Tengu have a mystic sense of the emotions within others, giving them +2 on [Sense Motive](skills/sense_motive.md) checks.
* __Feathered Body (Ex):__ When a Tengu makes a successful [Tumble](skills/tumble.md) check to reduce the effective height of a fall (DC 15), they can spread their arms and catch the wind, causing a _Father Fall_ type effect. They fall up to 60ft per round when gliding down in this way, and can glide 5ft sideways in any direction for each 5ft down. Fighting in mid air as they fall doesn't disrupt this ability, because that's totally sweet.
* __Hollow Bones (Ex):__ Tengu can use their Dexterity bonus instead of their Strength bonus on [Jump](skills/jump.md) checks, and they add their Base Attack Bonus to Jump checks.
* __Automatic Languages:__ Common and Auran.
* __Suggested Bonus Language:__ Celestial, Draconic, Elvish, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, Orc, Sylvan, and Terran.
