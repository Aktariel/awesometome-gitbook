# Open Game License

You can copy, modify, and distribute the files that make up the SuperTome in accordance with the Open Game License. All components of the project are Open Game Content. No portion of the project is Product Identity.

You can compare and contrast SuperTome with other works at any time. You can indicate compatibility between SupetTome and any other work at any time. For an explanation as to why I'm saying these seemingly pointless sentences, see Section 7 of the license.

The terms of the Open Gaming License Version 1.0a are as follows:
