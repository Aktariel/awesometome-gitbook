# Warrior
_"Guards! Get them!"_

The worlds have a multitude of powerful champions who slay dragons with their swords and break necromancers over their knees. But while these characters are often the primary focus of the game, the fact remains that the way of the sword is traveled quite frequently by orcs and elves alike, and the vast majority of those who do so are not actually capable of performing such awesome displays of martial prowess. These are the Warriors -- the people who wield weapons in a manner that is entirely unlikely to get their names told in lasting song and story.

__Warriors in the Game:__ Warriors aren't playable as PCs. They lack the depth and tactical versatility to be an interesting character and they are not powerful enough to pull their weight in any real adventuring setup.

__Hit Die:__ d8

__Class Skills:__ Balance, Climb, Craft, Escape Artist, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Jump, Listen, Profession, Ride, Spot, Survival, Swim, Use Rope.

__Skill Points Per Level:__ Warriors have 4 + IntMod skills at max ranks, and they do not track individual ranks.

__BAB:__ Full

__Saves:__ Fortitude and Reflex Poor, Will Good

## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ A Warrior is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as Light, Medium, and Heavy armor, and Shields.

__NPC Array:__ Warriors generally have the following stat array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8

__Replaceable (Ex):__ Warriors represent the faceless hordes of grunts, guards, and mooks. They are intended to be easy to use, and very easy to replace. Instead of worrying about the feats that a Warrior has, simply give Warriors +1 to-hit for each feat they would be eligible for.

__Signature Weaponry (Ex):__ 2nd level warriors get +1 to hit with the cultural weapons associated with their people. Dwarves get a bonus with the Dwarven Waraxe, Elves with the Elven Thinblade, and so on. For races without a cultural weapon, simply select the weapon that the warriors train the most with (Longswords, Spears, etc).

__Loyal to Death (Ex):__ 3rd level Warriors will fight to the death, and gain the Ferocity special ability (they remain conscious when below 0 hit points, though they are Disabled as normal).

__Veteran Spirit (Ex):__ 4th level Warriors gain +1hp per level.

__Unshakable Morale (Ex):__ 5th level Warriors receive a +2 bonus on saves vs. Fear.

__Trading Out Warrior Levels:__ Warrior levels aren't capable of doing anything that well. If for some reason a Warrior became an actual important character, they should become a member of a real character class. That is, simply trade levels of Warrior for levels in a real class that has a full BAB progression.
