# Aristocrat
_"Don't touch me! I might catch something."_

Many adventurers will settle down after a while and just become lords and ladies of some place or another. The direct children of such an individual will probably be trained in a PC class as well, to continue on the family line. There are, however, many members of the extended family and court that will grow up in the relative safety of castle life without actually getting the sort of training to be a bad-ass that they need to succeed in life on their own. These characters have the Aristocrat class.

__Adepts in the Game:__ Aristocrats aren't playable as PCs. While Experts play the part of support characters in towns and villages, Aristocrats act as the support characters of court and castle.

__Hit Die:__ d6

__Class Skills:__ Any.

__Skill Points Per Level:__ Aristocrats have 4 + IntMod skills at max ranks, and they do not track individual ranks.

__BAB:__ Medium

__Saves:__ Fort and Reflex poor, Will good.

## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ Aristocrats are proficient with simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields.

__NPC Array:__ Aristocrats generally have the following stat array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8

__Noble Blood (Ex):__ Aristocrats don't have feats. For each feat they would get, give them +1 to all saves and +1hp. Aristocrats, despite being NPCs, get maximum hit points at 1st level.

__Excessively Chatty (Ex):__ Aristocrats don't have much they need to do, so they usually end up getting up to a bunch of intrigue and gossip. Aristocrats of 2nd level or more add their level to any Charisma based skill check.

__Finer Things In Life (Ex):__ Aristocrats of 3rd level or more add their level to Appraise and Forgery checks.

__The Prince and the Pauper (Ex):__ Aristocrats of 4th level or more add their level to Disguise, Hide, and Move Silently checks.

__Undeserved Luck (Ex):__ Once per day when an Aristocrat of 5th level would be struck by an attack, they can force the attack to be re-rolled. Alternately, they can re-roll a saving throw. This ability can be triggered after they learn about the success or failure of the attack or save in question.

__Trading Out Aristocrat Levels:__ If an aristocrat gets their shit together and becomes a more major character they should trade our their aristocrat levels for levels in a PC class.
