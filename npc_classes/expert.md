# Expert

_"It'll take me three days to forge you one of those."_

Most towns people are simply common folk, but some have eaten enough to grow up properly, and they've managed to learn enough to be generally useful. These sorts of characters are experts.

__Experts in the Game:__ Experts aren't playable as PCs. They lack depth, and are generally intended to only represent the various support characters that the heroes meet and interact with on their travels. They might have a name, but they can't handle themselves that well when danger is around, and they rely on the relative peace of civilization to practice their trades and crafts.
