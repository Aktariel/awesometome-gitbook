# Adept

_"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble..."_

From time to time, characters will meet with an NPC that has minor magical powers, but that isn't really skilled enough to count as being among the PC spellcasting classes. These individuals are known as adepts, and many minor villages across the land are host to an adept or two if they're lucky.

__Adepts in the Game:__ Adepts aren't playable as PCs. They lack depth, and are generally intended to only represent the occasional magical abilities of characters that the PCs meet when they go places.

__Hit Die:__ d4

__Class Skills:__ Bluff, Craft, Diplomacy, Knowledge, Profession, Sense Motive, and Spellcraft.

__Skill Points Per Level:__ Adepts have 4 + IntMod skills at max ranks, and they do not track individual ranks.

__BAB:__ Low

__Saves:__ Fort and Reflex poor, Will good.

## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ Adepts are proficient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields. Adepts wearing armor are affected by spell failure chances.

__NPC Array:__ Adepts generally have the following stat array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8

__Hedge Mage:__ Adepts are intended to be able to cast a minor number of spells without bothering to track an actual spellcasting class. An adept knows 3 spells at 1st level, and learns an additional spell at each level thereafter. Adepts can learn any 1st level Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell. For ease of record keeping, an adept can cast each of their spells once per day per adept level. Adepts must perform Verbal and Somatic components for a spell as normal, and they must have and Material, Focus, or Divine Focus components available as well.

__Magical Proficiency (Ex):__ Adepts don't have feats. For each feat an adept would get, give them an additional spell known.

__Mage of the Second Circle (Ex):__ Starting at 3rd level, an Adept can learn 2nd level spells when they learn new spells.

__Trading Out Adept Levels:__ If an adept becomes a major character they should convert their Adept levels into levels in an actual spellcasting class.
