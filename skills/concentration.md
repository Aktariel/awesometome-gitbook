# Concentration

(Con)

## Maintain Focus

You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.

If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well.

The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. __If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC.__ If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.


* __Damaged During The Action:__ DC 10 + damage taken. This can come up either when you're concentrating on something that takes more than one round to complete (such as a spell with a long casting time, or a [Disable Device](skills/disable_device.md) check), or because of a readied action or Attack of Opportunity.
* __Taking continuous damage during the action:__ DC 10 + half of continuous damage last dealt.
* __Distracted by nondamaging spell:__ Distracting spell's save DC.
* __Vigorous Motion:__ DC 10. eg: on a moving mount, taking a bouncy wagon ride, in a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a stormtossed ship.
* __Violent Motion:__ DC 15. eg: on a galloping horse, taking a very rough wagon ride, in a small boat in rapids, on the deck of a storm-tossed ship.
* __Extraordinarily violent motion:__ DC 20. eg: earthquake.
* __Entangled:__ DC 15.
* __Grappled or Pinned:__ DC 20. You can also only cast spells without Somatic components and for which you already have the Material Components, Focus, and/or Divine Focus in hand.
* __Weather is a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet:__ DC 5
* __Weather is wind-driven hail, dust, or debris:__ DC 10
* __Weather caused by a spell:__ Spell's save DC. eg: Storm of Vengence.

Other sorts of situations might also be distracting, use the above as a guideline for such things.

* __Action:__ None. The check is made either in response to someone else, or as part of another action.
* __Try Again:__ No.

## Cast Defensively

You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn't apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity.

The DC of the check is 15 plus the spell's level. If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any Attacks of Opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn't allow you to Take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.

* __Action:__ None. The check is always made as part of another action.
* __Try Again:__ No.
