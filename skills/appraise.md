# Appraise

(Int)

## Estimate Market Value

You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at (2d6+3)*10% of its actual value (eg: 50% to 150%).

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item's value at all.

* __Action:__ Estimating market value takes at least 1 minute, possibly more.
* __Try Again:__ You can't appraise an object again, regardless of success or failure, until you gain more ranks in Appraise.

## Sense Magic

It's obvious enough to a trained eye when an item is infused with magic. With a DC 25 Appraise check, the presence or absence of magic within an item can be detected. (Further information can then be gained with a [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft.md) check.) Failure means that you can't sense anything either way.

* __Action:__ Close examination for magic takes at least 1 minute, possibly more.
* __Try Again:__ As with estimating market value, you can't try again until you gain more ranks in Appraise.
