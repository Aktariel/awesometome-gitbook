# Craft
(Int)

Like [Perform](skills/perform.md), Craft is a single skill that has many specializations. You can have a number of Craft specializations up to your ranks in craft. Most NPCs with ranks in craft only have one or two though. Generally, a craft specialization is based on working with material types, such as metal, stone, wood, clay, bone, hide, and so forth. You can also have specializations for making particular related groups of things even when they're not all the same materials, such as weapons, armor, or alchemical items.

You always need proper tools to perform crafting work. No tools gives you a -10 to your Craft check, assuming that you're able to work the material with your bare hands at all. The tools required to build things are usually DC 5 or 10, so it can sometimes even make sense to first craft your own tools and then craft the thing you really want. With normal tools your check is unmodified. With masterwork tools you get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.

A failed Craft check uses up 5% of the needed materials per point that you missed by, so you'll usually have to obtain more before you try again, unless you started with much more than you needed.

This part of the game, like a few others, can easily become so open ended that it's hard to make strong pronouncements. The rules of Craft are deliberately left relatively vague so that groups can kinda make up what they want to fill in the specifics with.

## Create An Item

With a Craft check and some time you can turn raw materials into much more useful sorts of things. The DC depends on the item, with suggestions on the table below.

| Item Complexity | DC |
|:----------------|:--:|
| Very Simple (wooden spoon) | 5 |
| Typical Item (iron pot) | 10 |
| High-quality item (bell) | 15 |
| Superior Item (lock) | 20 |
| Simple Melee Weapon | 12 |
| Martial Melee Weapon | 15 |
| Exotic Melee Weapon | 18 |
| Launcher (any category) | 20 |
| Armor/ Shield | 10 + Bonus |
| Masterwork Item | +5 |

To create an item, you also need the raw materials of course. Buying the materials for an item will generally run you one third of the item's full market price. Gathering the materials yourself can be done with a [Survival](skills/survival.md) check in the correct area.

* __Action:__ Extended, and varies wildly by item. It will almost assuredly take at least one minute to craft an item, so you won't really be doing it in combat either way.
* __Try Again:__ Yes.

## Repair An Item

When an item is damaged, you can repair it with a craft check. One check will restore 1d6 points of damage on the item. You generally need only a fraction of the item's market value in new materials, but it depends on the scope of the damage.

* __Action:__ Extended. It usually takes an hour's work to restore an item with a craft check.
* __Try Again:__ Yes.

## Repair a Construct

A damaged construct can sometimes repair itself, either with Fast Healing or because it's a Living Construct, but for other Constructs you make a Craft check. The DC is 15, and a successful check restores 1d6 hit points. You need 1 sp per hit die of the target in materials to repair a construct in this way. A construct repairing itself gets a +4 bonus on the check.

* __Action:__ Extended. It takes 8 hours of work to restore a construct with a craft check.
* __Try Again:__ Yes.

## Infuse Magical Item

Given the correct materials, you can make a magical item. To make a magical item with a market value above 15,000gp (a "Wish Economy" item) you need to have wish economy materials. For items with a market value below the Wish Economy line you can use normal sorts of mystical materials.

The general DC to craft a magical item is 15 for items that either only have a scaling bonus or have a minor special ability, 20 for items with a moderate special ability (ones below the wish item limit), and 25 for any items that are wish economy items.

You must be at least 3rd level to make any magical items other than scrolls and potions.

* __Action:__ Extended. It generally takes 1 day per 1,000gp in the market price of an item to craft it.
* __Try Again:__ Yes.

## Redesign Item

If you have a completed item and need to overhaul it in some way (such as resizing heavy armor to fit a new user), the DC is usually 5 less than to craft the item in the first place. Depending on what you're doing, you'll need some materials and time, but usually the time taken is much less than it would be to make a new item from scratch.

* __Action:__ Extended, and varies wildly by item and by what you're changing.
* __Try Again:__ Yes. In addition to wasting materials, a failure by 5 or more points leaves the item itself in a temporarily unusable state until more work is done to either complete the process or undo the process.

## Recover Materials

You can disassemble existing items carefully to recover some of the materials that went into making it. A careful disassembly has a DC 5 less than to craft the item and takes as long as to craft the item, but recovers 25% of the item's market value in materials.

A speedy disassembly takes only half as long but only recovers 10% of the item's market value.

* __Action:__ Extended, varies by item.
* __Try Again:__ No.

## Spell Interactions

* _Fabricate_ lets you make raw materials into a finished item in a single instantaneous casting. You still have to make the appropriate Craft check, however. You can't have assistance on a Fabricate check, but other modifiers (such as from tools or lack thereof) apply. Might seem weird, but the magic just works like that. A failed check during the casting causes the spell to shred the materials you're working with instead of turning them into whatever useful thing you wanted. Fabricate can't accelerate the infusion of magic into an item, it only speeds up mundane crafting.
* _Wood Shape_ works exactly like Fabricate, but it only works on a single piece of wood at a time, and you take a -5 on your Craft check.
* _Creation_ spells, such as Minor Creation, Major Creation, and True Creation, all require that you make a successful Craft check during the spell's casting. A failure causes the spell to make a useless lump of whatever material your item would have been made of.

* __Action:__ As the spell.
* __Try Again:__ Yes.
