# Monk
_"I am a Grand Master of Flowers. You are not."_

Fantasy literature's view of the "martial artist" has about as much to do with a real martial artist as its view of salamanders has to do with real salamanders. But let's face the facts: Monks are totally sweet. They flip out and kill people _with their hands_. A monk does not practice any sort of "real" martial art, we call those people "Fighters". A monk practices an entirely magical martial art that only works in areas where badgers can talk and winged horses can fly.

## Playing a Monk

Every Monk follows a different martial path that involves jumping super high and having glowing things coming off of their hands when they perform their super moves. Some monks use weapons, but most just use their hands and feet to devastating effect. Some Monks shout the names of their techniques in battle to demoralize their opponents, others stay aloof and silent during even the toughest of challenges.

## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ Monks are proficient with all simple weapons, as well any weapon defined as a special monk weapon, such as the sai, the nunchuka, the kama, the shuriken, and the triple staff. Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields of any kind.

__Armored in Life (Su):__ A Monk has a special Armor bonus whenever they are not using armor or a shield. This Armor Bonus applies against Touch Attacks and Incorporeal Touch Attacks, and has a value of 4 + half level. The Monk can wear any "non-armor" outfit (eg: normal clothing, or camouflage clothing), including magical versions, while retaining their armored in life bonus. Other effects that grant an Armor bonus (such as Bracers of Armor, or the Mage Armor spell) don't stack with Armored in Life (only use the highest bonus).

__Willow Step (Su):__ A true monk does not seek to outrun the fist, but to anticipate it. If a Monk would be allowed to add his Dexterity modifier to a Reflex Save or Armor Class, he may add his Wisdom bonus (if positive) instead.

__Fatal Strike (Su):__ A Monk has a natural weapon Slam in addition to whatever else he is capable of doing. As a natural slam attack, if he uses no other natural or manufactured weapons he adds his Strength and a half to damage and may make iterative attacks if he has sufficient BAB. If the slam is used with other weaponry, it becomes a secondary natural attack, suffers a -5 penalty to-hit, and adds only half his Strength modifier to damage. A monk's slam attack does a base of 1d8 damage for a medium sized monk and does more or less damage as appropriate if the Monk is larger or smaller than medium size.

__Fighting Style (Su):__ At levels 1, 3, 5, and 7, the Monk learns a Fighting Style. Each Fighting style requires a Swift Action to activate, lasts one round, and is usable at will. Each Fighting Style must have a name (see Naming Your Fighting Style, at the end), and provides two bonuses from the Basic Fighting Style Abilities list. Fighting Style effects that force a target struck to make a saving throw always have a DC of 10 + half level + wisdom modifier, and a creature struck only has to make one save per effect type per round (even if they're struck more than once). Effects that imitate a spell always have a caster level equal to your level.

* +4 Dodge Bonus to AC.
* +4 Dodge Bonus to Saving Throws.
* Concealment.
* +30ft Bonus to your movement rate.
* You can move through occupied spaces as if they were unoccupied and you provoke no attacks of opportunity for your movement.
* You can make an attack of opportunity against any opponent who attacks you. This attack of opportunity must be a trip or disarm attempt.
* Any opponent struck by your slam attack must make a Fortitude Save or be Stunned for one round.
* Your slam attacks to ignore hardness and DR.
* Your slam attacks inflict piercing damage and also 2 points of Constitution damage.
* Your slam attacks inflict slashing damage and reduce your opponent's movement rate by 10ft every time they suffer damage from it. This movement rate reduction can be healed like ability damage (treating 5ft of movement as 1 point of ability damage).
* Any bonuses your fighting style gives to your slam attack apply to any weapon attack you make. Ranged attacks must target creatures within 30ft to get your fighting style bonuses.

__Walk of a Thousand Steps (Su):__ Once per day, a Monk of sixth level or higher may activate a Fighting Style and extend its duration to 1 round/level rather than 1 round. Activating this Fighting Style is still a Swift Action. Other Fighting Styles may be activated during this period, though their duration is normally going to be only 1 round.

__Master Fighting Style (Su):__ At levels 9, 11, and 13, the Monk learns a Master Fighting Style. These are just like normal Fighting Styles, but select from a new list of abilities below.

* Total Concealment. 
* Your slam attacks become Force effects that inflict Force damage.
* Any creature struck with your slam attack is affected as if by a _Banishment_ effect that transports it back to its home plane unless it succeeds at a Will save. Outsiders suffer a -4 penalty to their saving throw. A creature so banished, may not return to the plane it was banished from for a year.
* Any creature struck by your slam attack must make a Reflex Save or be Helpless for one round.
* Gain the effects of an _Air Walk_ spell and get a +20ft bonus to your movement speed.
* Any opponent tripped or bullrushed by you is automatically affected by a violent thrust from a _Telekinesis_ effect.

* Damage from your slam attacks can only heal while the target is within a _Consecrate_ effect.
* Every creature within 10 feet of you must make a Will save or become Panicked for one minute.

If the monk isn't restored to life by something else, they can choose to _Reincarnate_ themselves after being dead for 1d4 weeks.

__Master of the Four Seasons (Su):__ Time passes relentlessly in the world, but for a monk of 14th level, the change of seasons is as no change at all. The monk ceases to age.
