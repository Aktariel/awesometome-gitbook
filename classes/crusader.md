# Crusader
_"All of my organs yearn to see this task done."_

The Crusader is a martial adept who is dedicated to and driven by some sort of cause. It may be good or evil, law or chaos, racial purity, religious conviction, or something else entirely. The Crusader trains hard and learns many forms of combat, but while in the heat of battle they are driven by inspiration. Some say they are guided by the divine, others that they simply train with too many forms to have a reliable battle order when blades are drawn.

Many Crusaders are members of specific schools of martial adeptness. These schools stress martial virtues, train with specific weaponry, and have identifiable styles. A character familiar with martial adepts can easily identify a Crusader's school simply by watching them fight. Your campaign world may have special schools of martial thought in it, discuss it with your Dungeon Master. The assumed schools of martial combat are White Raven (which uses the spiked chain, three section staff, and full blade), Devoted Dragon (which uses the shard sword, the skip rock, and the thin blade), Earth Spirit (which uses the war axe, the dire pick, and the ribbon dagger), Storm Guardian (which uses the pincer staff, the harpoon, and the net), and Amethyst Mind (which uses the maul, the mancatcher, and the shotput).

## Playing A Crusader

Many of a Crusader's abilities are triggered off of Charisma, and until the Crusader gains a few levels they will not have much in the way of abilities that function outside of melee range. Crusaders therefore are usually made with Charisma and Strength as primary attributes. In combat, a Crusader is fairly resilient and should usually find themselves pushed to the front line. Out of combat, Crusaders generally contribute to the party with social and leadership abilities.

## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ A Crusader is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Crusaders are also proficient with light, medium, and heavy armor as well as with shields and great shields. If the Crusader is a member of a church or school, the character gains proficiency with their favored weapons, even if those weapons are exotic.

__Crusader Maneuvers (Ex):__ Crusaders can use special combat techniques called "maneuvers". Maneuvers come as Strikes (which are Standard Actions), Counters (which are Immediate Actions), and Boosts (which are Swift Actions that normally have 1 round durations). A Crusader can use each available maneuver once before it becomes expended, however they get new available maneuvers every round (which may include maneuvers expended the previous round). Initiating a maneuver is an Extraordinary ability. At first level, a Crusader knows 6 maneuvers, and learns two additional maneuevers every time they gain a level. A Crusader may also learn new maneuvers by undergoing a one day "training montage" with a teacher who knows the maneuver in question, or an exhaustive written description of how the maneuver is performed. In order to learn a new maneuver, the character must meet the level requirement of it.

If a Crusader's maneuvers or stances call on an opponent to make a saving throw, the DC is 10 + half level + Charisma modifier. If the Crusader is not in a battle and has not rolled initiative, they can be expected to be able to use any of their maneuvers given some time to psyche themselves up. Figure about one full round action to choose a specific maneuver if for some reason it is important enough to count time in rounds but not stressful enough that the character would roll initiative or otherwise be under threat.

__Maneuvers Readied and Available:__ Though a Crusader can use their abilities an unlimited number of times per day, they have a limited number of Maneuvers that are "ready" at any given time. Further, the Crusader relies upon the flash of divine or fanatical inspiration in battle and does not have full control over what maneuvers can be used at any given moment. The Crusader can change what maneuvers they have readied with five minutes of prayer and planning, but each round the Crusader randomly determines which maneuvers are "available" from among their readied maneuvers. The maneuvers are determined randomly at the beginning of the Crusader's turn, and continue to be available until the beginning of the character's next turn.

At first level, a Crusader can ready 6 maneuvers and two are available each round. The character may not ready more or less maneuvers than their maximum, and all readied maneuvers must be different. At 7th level, the number of maneuvers the Crusader readies increases to 8 and the number that are available each round increases to 3. These increase to 10 and 4 at 12th level, and 12 and 5 at 17th.

__Determining Available Maneuvers:__ Probably the easiest way to generate your available maneuvers each round is to take six cards out of a regular poker deck (more for higher level Crusaders) and write the card symbols next to the maneuvers you want to ready. Then each turn shuffle the cards you had last turn into the cards you didn't have and deal yourself 2 new cards (more for higher level Crusaders). More enterprising players might want to write the actual names of their maneuvers onto cards and then prepare a new "deck" when they ready different maneuvers. A player could also use dice: write down a number next to each readied maneuver and then roll 2d6 (or 3d8, 4d10, or 5d12 for higher level Crusaders), with repeated numbers being rerolled until all dice are unique. The method you use isn't terribly important, so long as each maneuever has an equal chance of appearing each round.

__Stances:__ A Stance is like a Boost that the Crusader can always use regardless of what maneuvers are ready or available. Each round they may expend a Swift Action to enact one of their known stances for one round. A Crusader knows one Stance at first level and learns a new one every three levels after that (levels 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19). However, whenever a Crusader gains a level of any class, they may forget one of the Stances they know and learn a new Stance that they qualify for.

__Furious Counterstrike (Ex):__ A Crusader has one Immediate Action __and__ one Swift Action each turn, instead of one or the other.

__Steely Resolve (Ex):__ At 2nd level, a Crusader gains Fast Healing equal to half their character level when they are at less than half hit points.

__Banner of Conviction (Ex):__ Allies within line of sight of a 2nd level Crusader gain a +2 Morale Bonus on saves versus Fear and to Morale tests.

__Indomitable Soul (Ex):__ At 3rd level, a Crusader adds their Charisma modifier (if positive) to all Saving Throws.

__Mettle (Ex):__ If a 4th level Crusader succeeds at a saving throw against an effect that is Fortitude or Will partial, the effect is negated as if the line read "Fortitude Negates" or "Will Negates".

__Zealous Surge (Ex):__ A 5th level Crusader can reroll one Saving Throw per day. This does not require an action.

__Smite (Ex):__ A 6th level Crusader can declare a "Smite" and gain an extra Swift Action (perhaps to use a Boost and a Stance, or two Stances in a turn or whatever). The Smite can only be declared once each until the next time the character readies maneuvers (though they need not actually change which maneuvers they are readying).

__Interrupting Fury (Ex):__ A 6th level Crusader adds a bonus equal to their Charisma modifier to attack rolls made on other character's turns. The bonus is gained whether the attack is made because of an attack of opportunity, the effects of a Counter, a readied action, or any other effect that causes the Crusader to get an attack during another character's turn.

__Never Give Up (Ex):__ An 8th level Crusader is not rendered unconscious by having more Subdual Damage than they have remaining hit points. Also, they remain concious while at negative hit points.

__Very Persuasive (Ex):__ A 9th level Crusader gains a bonus to Intimidate checks equal to their ranks in the Intimidate skill. They also gain a +3 bonus to their Leadership score (if any).

__Never Surrender (Ex):__ A 10th level Crusader is immune to [Compulsion] and [Fear] effects.

__So Much Smiting (Ex):__ An 11th level Crusader may use their Smite every round, essentially giving them 2 Swift Actions per turn all the time.

__So Much Zealotry (Ex):__ A 13th level Crusader regains the use of their Zealous Surge every time they ready maneuvers.

__Improved Mettle (Ex):__ If a 14th level Crusader fails a Fortitude Partial or Will Partial save, they are affected with the partial effect as if a character without Mettle had succeeded at the save.

__Keep Fighting (Ex):__ A 15th level Crusader can extend the duration of their stances or boosts from one round to two rounds. They may trigger this ability a number of times equal to their Charisma modifier each time they ready maneuvers. Extending a Boost or Stance is not an action.

__Leadership:__ At 16th level, a Crusader gains a [Leadership] feat as a bonus feat.

__Weapon Focus:__ At 18th level, the Crusader gains Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization as bonus feats.

__World Conquest (Ex):__ At 20th level, a Crusader wins the game.

## Crusader Techniques

### Naming Your Crusader Techniques

Techniques of Crusaders, whether they are stances or maneuvers, have individual names. These are generally procedurally generated as described below and contain a "unique bit". The unique bit for a technique could be anything, but established schools of Crusading have terms that they use over and over again. Below are pieces of text commonly used by several schools as well as some "generic" pieces of text you might put into your technique names regardless of what school you belong to (if any).

| White Raven | Devoted Dragon | Stone Spirit | Storm Guardian | Amethyst Mind | Generic |
|:------------|:---------------|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:--------|
| War | Righteous | Rock | Rain | Diamond | Eastern/East |
| Wings | Golden Wyvern | Cavern | Hurricane | Ruby | Western/West |
| Victory | Guardian | Hope | Wind | Sapphire | Northern/North |
| Covering | Dragon | Piercer | Tumult | Glass | Southern/South |
| Gambit | Flame | Mantle | Mountain | Obsidian | [Character's Name] |
| Leader | Fiery | Trapper | Dark cloud | Blue | Elothar |
| Tactics | Faith | Lurker | bingo | Emerald | Perfect |
| White Raven | Metal | Loyalty | Wave | Topaz | Justice |
| White | Burning | Hammer | Depression | Singular | Rage |

### Crusader Maneuvers

A Crusader's maneuvers can follow several naming conventions, which broadly fall into the category of "[Unique Bit] [Table Entry]" and "[Table Entry] [Unique Bit]". However, they can be tied together with possessives or prepositions in any way that makes them seem to flow better. Common choices for connectors are things like "of the". So by choosing the table entry "Nightmare Blade" and the unique bit "Dragon", you could plausibly have "The Dragon Nightmare Blade", "Dragon's Nightmare Blade", "Nightmare Blade Dragon", "Nightmare Blade of Dragon", or "Nightmare Blade of the Dragon". You can also experiment with converting nouns to adjectival forms to make things like "Draconic Nightmare Blade". Really: go nuts. Each maneuver can have its own unique bit or not. Use "Gatotsu" for everything or use a different color for each one, both can be cool.

### Crusader Stances

All stances are essentially Boosts in that they take a Swift Action to enact and last until the beginning of the Crusader's next turn. Each Crusader should name their stances, with the nomenclature of "[Unique Bit] [Ability Entry] Stance".
