## Playing a Barbarian

Playing a Barbarian is actually very easy. In general, you hit things, and they fall down. A Barbarian's action in almost any circumstance can plausibly be "I hit it with my great axe!" As such, a Barbarian character can be a good method to introduce a new player to the game or kill some orcs when you've had a few glasses of brew.

## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ Barbarians are proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.

__Rage (Ex):__ When doing melee damage to a foe, or being struck by a foe, a Barbarian may choose to enter a Rage as an Immediate Action. While Raging, a Barbarian gains a +2 Morale bonus to attack and damage with all melee attacks. He also gains +2 to saves, -2 to AC, and he gains DR X/-, where X is half his barbarian level (rounded down) +2. For example, a 1st level Barbarian has DR 2/- while Raging and a 10th level Barbarian has DR 7/- while Raging.

While Raging, a Barbarian may not cast spells, activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, or drop his weapons or shield. Rage lasts until he has neither struck an enemy for three consecutive rounds nor suffered damage from an enemy for three consecutive rounds. He may voluntarily end a Rage as a full-round action.

__Fast Healing (Ex):__ Barbarians shrug off wounds that would cripple a lesser man, and have learned to draw upon deep reserves of energy and stamina. At 1st level, they gain Fast Healing 1. At 5th level this becomes Fast Healing 5, Fast Healing 10 at 10th level, Fast Healing 15 at 15th level, and Fast Healing 20 at 20th level. This healing only applies while he is _not_ raging.

A multi-class barbarian only benefits from this ability as long as they have at least 4 levels of barbarian.

__Rage Dice (Ex):__ While Raging, a Barbarian of 2nd level or higher gets +1d6 damage per two full barbarian levels on all attacks they get from their Base Attack Bonus (but not attacks granted from other sources, such as Haste, Two-weapon Fighting, or Attacks of Opportunity). As with all bonus damage dice, these bonus dice are not multiplied on a critical hit.

__Combat Movement (Ex):__ While Raging, a Barbarian of 2nd level or more can move with increadible speed. If the barbarian spends a Move Action to move he adds 5ft per two full barbarian levels to his speed for that action. This only applies to move actions, and not to other actions that allow the barbarian to move, such as charges or withdraws.

__Battle Hardened (Ex):__ At 3rd level, a Raging Barbarian's mind has been closed off from distractions by the depths of his bloodlust and battle fury. While Raging, he may use his Fortitude Save in place of his Will Save. If he is under the effects of a Compulsion or Fear effect, he may act normally while Raging as if he was inside a _Protection From Evil_ effect.

__Sidestep Hazards (Ex):__ At 5th level, a Raging Barbarian learns to sidestep hazards with an intuitive and primal danger sense. While Raging, he may use his Fortitude Save in place of his Reflex Save.

__Great Blows (Ex):__ At 7th level, a Raging Barbarian's melee attacks are Great Blows. Any enemy struck by the Barbarian's melee or thrown weapon attacks must make a Fort Save or be stunned for one round. No enemy can be targeted by this ability more than once a round, and the save DC for this ability is 10 + half the Barbarian's level + his Constitution modifier.

__Great Life (Ex):__ While Raging, a 9th level Barbarian is immune to nonlethal damage, death effects, stunning, critical hits, negative levels, and ability damage (but not ability drain).

__Call the Horde (Ex):__ An 11th level Barbarian becomes a hero of his people. He gains the Command feat as a bonus feat, but his followers must all be Barbarians. In campaigns that do not use Leadership feats, he instead gains a +2 unnamed bonus to all saves.

__Watched by Totems (Ex):__ At 13th level, a Barbarian may immediately reroll any failed save. He may do this no more than once per failed save.

__Primal Assault (Ex):__ At 15th level, a Raging Barbarian's may choose to radiate an effect similar to an _Antimagic Field_ when he enters a Rage, with a caster level equal to his HD. Unlike a normal Antimagic Field, this effect does not suppress magic effects on him or the effects of magic items he is wearing or holding.

__Savagery (Ex):__ At 17th level, a Raging Barbarian may take a full round action to make a normal melee attack that has an additional effect similar to a _Disjunction_. Unlike a normal Disjunction, this effect only targets a single item or creature struck.

__One With The Beast (Ex):__ At 19th level, a Barbarian no longer needs to be in a Rage to use any Barbarian ability.
