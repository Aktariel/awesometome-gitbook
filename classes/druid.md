## Class Features

__Weapon and Armor Proficiency:__ Druids are proficient with the club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. Druids are proficient with Light and Medium armor, and with shields, but they cannot use armor or shields made from metal. Druids that wear prohibited armor can't use and of their druidic supernatural abilities or cast druid spells for 24 hours.

__Spells:__ Druids cast divine spells drawn from the Druid Spell List. A druid's Wisdom score determines all aspects of their spellcasting, such as Saving Throw DC, bonus spells, and so forth. The druid's base number of spells per day is given on the chart below. As with most divine casters, druids can use any spell on the druid spell list.

A druid regains their spells by spending an hour in prayer, contemplating nature and its forces. This must be performed each day at a time determined by the druid's specific belief system; generally at a time of mystical significance, such as dawn, dusk, midday, or midnight. If a druid misses the opportunity, they must stop and pray at the first chance, or they cannot regain spells that day.

A druid gets access to 3 Orisons (0th level spells) per day, and can use any prepared orison at will.

__Spontaneous Summons (Ex):__ At any time, a druid can convert a prepared spell into a _Summon Nature's Ally_ spell of equivalent level.

__Druidic Speech (Su):__ Druids know a special manner of communication that's only available to druids. It's like a language, in that it can convey information, but it generally is only good at communicating concepts relating to nature's ways and course. Druidic has its own alphabet. Non-druids can't ever learn the Druidic language; no matter how hard they try, it always slips from their mind.

__Animal Companion (Ex):__ A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind. At 1st and 2nd level the animal is totally typical. Once the druid reaches 3rd level, the animal companion becomes a Cohort, and it advances along with the druid (it has a CR equal to 2 less than the druid's level). The druid has +4 on Handle Animals checks with their Animal Companion, and can direct them as a free action. If the animal companion dies the druid can summon another one given 24 hours of prayer.

__Nature Sense (Ex):__ Druids get +2 on Knowledge (Nature) and Survival checks.

__Wild Empathy (Ex):__ Druids can make Diplomacy checks against animals and magical beasts. When making Wild Empathy checks, use the druid's level in place of their Diplomacy ranks, if that would be better for them.

__Woodland Stride (Ex):__ A 2nd level druid can move through undergrowth at full speed, without taking damage. Magically hindering terrain affects the druid normally.

__Trackless Step (Ex):__ A 3rd level druid never leaves a trail if they don't want to.

__Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):__ A 4th level druid gets a +4 on saves against the spell-like abilities of Fey.

__Wild Shape (Su):__ 
At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Each time you use wild shape, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night.

Any gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When the druid reverts to her true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on her body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the druid's feet.

The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.

The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.

At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.)

At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.

At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.

__Venom Immunity (Ex):__ At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

__A Thousand Faces (Su):__ At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the disguise self spell, but only while in her normal form. This affects the druid's body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

__Timeless Body (Ex):__ After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer ages.
