# NPC Classes

There's a lot of PC Characters within the world, and there's a lot of monsters that can clash on even footing with PC characters, but what there's a lot _more_ of than either of those groups is low level NPCs filling in all the background roles that keep the world running.

Characters with NPC class levels have a few common rules:

* __No Skill Ranks:__ Characters with NPC classes don't track individual skill ranks. They just get a number of skills to have that always count as being at max ranks.
* __No Feats:__ Characters with NPC classes don't get feats. Instead, for each feat they would normally get the character gets some sort of fixed bonus (depending on their class).
* __Simple Stats:__ NPC classed characters have a common stat array they use, modified by racial ability adjustments as normal.
  * Non-Commoner Array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8
  * Commoner Array: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10
* __Max Level:__ NPC classed individuals never go above level 5. If they should have cause to be more than 5th level, give them levels in a real class.
* __No Multiclassing:__ NPC classes shouldn't multiclass at all. If someone is important enough to make them some sort of muliclass setup then give them levels in a real class.
* __Low CR:__ NPC classed individuals have a CR equal to half of their level. In order to keep this from being potentially unbalanced, we strongly suggest that they show up in groups. So while a 4th level Warrior is nominally a CR 2 opponent, he's not really a good challenge for a 2nd level party. But 2 of them are an appropriate challenge for a 4th level party. And that's really what they're for: showing up in groups and getting smacked around anyway.
